                <ul>
                    <li>For this story, published A1 in The Herald-Mail, I featured a little-known group in Hagerstown
                     helping Afghanistan refugees. I interviewed the volunteers and faith leaders, after gaining
                    their trust. During the reporting process, I ensured them that the identity of the refugee families
                    would be kept secret and stories included would remain general, as to not futher endanger any of the families.</li>
