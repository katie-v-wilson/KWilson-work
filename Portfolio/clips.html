                    <li>In this multi-month-long project, Giuseppe LoPiccolo and I followed four candidates in the College Park, Maryland, special mayoral election to provide an inside look into the mental and practical challenges of running in a local election. I interviewed candidates, followed them on the campaign trail and wrote the story. LoPiccolo took the photos and wrote captions.

I then wrote this story, covering both the shock of the closure to the business owners and the historical similarities the closure had to another instance of College Park developments pushing out communities of color.

                <ul>
                    <li>I pitched this story idea, a breakdown of how three mayoral candidates voted during their city council tenures, in the midst of campaigns for a special election. The city was reeling with the arrest of the mayor, and now three council members were vying for the same seat. At this point, I had reported on the College Park City Council for nearly 1.5 years and wanted to put my knowledge of each council member out for the voters. As I was watching each candidate’s electioneering, I noticed that few mentioned specific council votes and I wanted to give voters an accurate depiction of how candidates really vote. I chose these four votes due to their recency and because they are all split votes - a rare occurrence in the College Park City Council.

                <ul>
                    <li>For this story, published A1 in The Herald-Mail, I featured a little-known group in Hagerstown
                     helping Afghanistan refugees. I interviewed the volunteers and faith leaders, after gaining
                    their trust. During the reporting process, I ensured them that the identity of the refugee families
                    would be kept secret and stories included would remain general, as to not futher endanger any of the families.</li>
